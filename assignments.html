        <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
        <p>
          Interactive web application that demonstrates the KMeans clustering algorithm using various initialization methods and allows for the exploration of the impact of different initialization strategies on the clustering outcome.

        <h2>Assignment 3</h2>
        <p>
          IPYNB that applies a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) implementation as a preprocessing step to the MNIST dataset and trains a logistic regression classifier. Model performance and training time when using different levels of SVD for dimensionality reduction is analyzed.

        <h2>Assignment 4</h2>
        <p>
        Interactive webpage where users can type queries and retrieve documents from a predefined dataset. The task involves applying LSA to reduce the dimensionality of the document-term matrix and using cosine similarity to measure the relevance of documents to the user’s query.

        <h2>Assignment 5</h2>
        <p>
            Given a dataset containing information about customers, such as their demographics, account balance, and salary, I built a model to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the bank) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones and by accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, banks can take proactive steps to improve customer retention.

        <h2>Assignment 6</h2>
        <p>
            An interactive webpage that explores the impact of changing parameters on linear regression, especially when there is no actual relationship between X and Y. By tweaking the settings, one can observe how randomness can influence the slope and intercept in a regression model.
